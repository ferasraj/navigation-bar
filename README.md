# Navigation Bar

## Description

This is a responsive and interactive circular navigation menu designed for modern websites. It includes social media icons (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, Discord, WhatsApp, Snapchat, YouTube, WeChat) that expand outward when activated. The menu also features a close button to collapse the items back into the center.

Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this navigation bar is fully customizable and easy to integrate into any project. It uses **Ionicons** for the social media icons, ensuring clean and modern visuals.

## Customization

### Changing Icons

To replace or add new icons, update the `<ion-icon>` elements in the `index.html` file. You can find a full list of available icons [here](https://ionic.io/ionicons).

Example:

```html
<span style="--i: 0; --x: -1; --y: 0">
  <ion-icon name="logo-github"></ion-icon>
</span>
```

### Adjusting Positions

To change the positions of the icons, modify the `--x` and `--y` CSS variables in the `style` attribute of each `<span>` element. These values determine the direction and distance of the expansion.

Example:

```html
<span style="--i: 0; --x: -1; --y: 0"></span>
<!-- Moves left -->
<span style="--i: 1; --x: 0; --y: -1"></span>
<!-- Moves up -->
```

### Styling

You can customize the appearance of the navigation bar by editing the `styles.css` file. For example:

- Change the background color of the dots:
  ```css
  .main .navigation span {
    background: #your-color;
  }
  ```
- Modify the size of the icons:
  ```css
  .main .navigation span ion-icon {
    font-size: 24px; /* Adjust size */
  }
  ```
